        <h1>Filming on Campus<br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.utoronto.ca"><span class="sub_title">University of Toronto, Downtown Campus <span>&#10140;</span></span></a></h1>
        <section>
          <p>All filming requests require approval from the Academic + Campus Events Department before any
            arrangements for filming can be made. A contract and proof of liability insurance is required
            before any and all filming that allows access to non-public spaces or access to a public
            space that may cause any type of distraction or disruption. Filming of students is prohibited
            unless that student has provided advance written permission to be filmed. The ACE Film Liaison
            Officer can assist with coordinating the services and logistics that may be required. Similarly,
            if you are contemplating using any of the University's property as a film location, other
            than for <a href="weddinghome.html">wedding photo sessions</a> please contact the
            <a href="mailto:arielle.berube@utoronto.ca">Film Liasion Officer</a>.
          </p>
          <p>The University of Toronto has an agreement with the Film Directors Guild, the City of Toronto
            and the Province of Ontario, whereby the University will let commercial filming use some
            of its buildings and grounds as location sites for a fee, provided that, among other things,
            such filming activities and their locations are first vetted and approved by the University
            and that they do not unduly disrupt University activities. To that end, there is a University
            Policy on Film Liaison.

                  <li>The Policy for Film Liaison will not apply to news and public affairs coverage of University
                    events, activities and personalities by television, film or sound recording. This
                    coverage will be approved and arranged by the University's Department of Public Affairs.
                    Coverage of sports events will be approved and arranged by the Department of Athletics
                    and Recreation. When news and public affairs coverage includes complex documentary
                    filming, the University's Policy for Film Liaison will apply, including fees, and
                    assistance will be provided by the Film Liaison Service.
                  </li>
                  <li>All other requests to use University buildings, grounds and facilities for the purposes
                    of filming will be handled by the Film Liaison Service.
                  </li>
                  <li>The Service will coordinate access to all areas on the St. George campus, except for
                    the federated and affiliated colleges (a list of these colleges is listed on page
                    4). Due to its status as a memorial, neither film nor photo shoots are permitted
                    at or within Soldiers' Tower.
                  </li>
                  <li>No film location request will be approved which seriously disrupts the normal activities
                    of the University.
                  </li>
                  <li>Permission to film inside University buildings, with the exception of space that is
                    normally available for rental, will only be granted when such locations are unique
                    and not available elsewhere. The wide range of interior locations and the convenience
                    of the University's Film Liaison Service are not criteria for accessibility.
                  </li>
                  <li>For interior locations, the Film Liaison Service must secure approval from the Administrative
                    Officer(s) of the division(s) occupying the space requested.
                  </li>
                  <li>No major set construction or alteration of buildings will be permitted. Any set decoration
                    must be clearly specified in writing and all areas occupied in connection with the
                    filming must be returned to their normal condition.
                  </li>
                  <li>A program script will be submitted prior to the commencement of filming so that the
                    Film Liaison Service can ascertain that such filming will not damage the reputation
                    or image of the University.
                  </li>
                  <li>No weapons, ammunition or fireworks (authentic or replica) are permitted on University

                  <li>For productions that do not involve University events and activities, every effort
                    should be made to maintain the anonymity of the University, including promotion and
                    credits; the University, however, may require that it be identified if it feels this
                    would be in its interest.
                  </li>
                  <li>Whenever a Location Fee is being charged, an agreement will be entered into between
                    the University and the Production agency (see attached Form of Agreement).
                  </li>
                  <li>Requests for filming must normally be made at least two weeks in advance and in no
                    case will be accepted fewer than ten days in advance.
                  </li>
                  <li>Notwithstanding the terms and conditions of this policy, the Film Liaison Service has
                    the right to refuse any request for filming on the premises of the University. Factors
                    in such a decision may include the reputation and financial security of the production
                    agency, and the history of previous dealings with that agency.

                <p class="important">Fees and policy listed here are subject to confirmation with ACE / University Film Liaison</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>A Location Fee of <span class="cost">$4,000</span> per day will be charged to any production
                    agency using University locations for the purposes of producing feature films, television
                    commercials, and general entertainment programs.
                  </li>
                  <li>The <strong>Location Fee</strong> may be waived for non-commercial production agencies
                    and public broadcasting institutions producing educational and public interest programs,
                    including documentaries.
                  </li>
                  <li>A minimum <strong>Survey and Clearance Fee</strong> of <span class="cost">$100</span>                    will be charged to all users of the Film Liaison Service as soon as it is apparent
                    to the Film Liaison Service that a University location may be suitable for their
                    needs. Assessing such a fee, payable in advance, does not imply that final permission
                    will be granted. This fee may be waived for student groups producing films as part
                    of their academic program at other educational institutions.
                  </li>
                  <li>When a Location Fee is assessed, the Survey and Clearance Fee will be deducted.</li>
                  <li>For <strong>interior locations</strong>, up to one-third of the Location Fee received
                    will, where appropriate, be distributed amongst those divisions occupying the space
                    being used.
                  </li>
                  <li>Where <strong>rental charges</strong> normally exist for certain University rooms (e.g.
                    Convocation Hall, Innis Town Hall), that charge will be paid out of the Location
                    Fee up to a maximum of 50% of the Location Fee. University divisions that normally
                    rent space may waive their normal rental charges in lieu of receiving one-third of
                    the Location Fee.
                  </li>
                  <li>The cost of any additional services provided by the University, including <strong>security, parking,
                  trades and caretaking</strong>, will be charged in addition to the Location Fee. Because
                    of existing union contracts, security and other applicable trades must be provided
                    by the University. Decisions as to which of these services are required for any film
                    location will be decided by the University in accordance with general policy and
                    procedures. For every location, at least one security officer must be engaged.
                  </li>
                  <li>The <strong>Survey and Clearance Fee</strong> will be payable to the University prior
                    to the undertaking of location surveys and coordinating arrangements. Location Fees
                    will be payable prior to the commencement of filming. Other fees will be payable
                    when billed.
                  </li>
                  <li>Production agencies filming at the University must agree to hold the University harmless
                    of any <strong>liability and loss</strong> which the University may suffer or incur
                    by reason of any injury to any person or damage to any property caused by the Producer
                    or any of its employees or equipment, or any other persons introduced to the premises
                    by reason of such filming. Evidence must be provided of liability insurance coverage
                    in the amount of at least $2,000,000 and showing The Governing Council of the University
                    of Toronto as co-insured, and a bond may be required according to the procedures
                    of the Academic and Campus Events whenever major damage might be done to University
                    property.
                  </li>
                  <li>All arrangements, including the payment of Location Fees, evidence of insurance, and
                    the execution of agreements or posting of bonds when required, must be completed
                    at least <strong>48
                  hours</strong> prior to the commencement of filming.
                  </li>
                  <li>A <strong>Cancellation Fee</strong> of 50% of the payable Location Fee will be charged.
                    Rescheduling of dates will be considered as a new request. The Survey and Clearance
                    Fee is not refundable.
                  </li>
                  <li>Production agencies filming at the University which need auxiliary sources of
                    <strong>power</strong> must use silenced generators and suspend or cover all cables
                    at their own expense.
