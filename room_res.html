            <a href="documents/ACTUS_Annoucement_to_Campus_Groups.pdf" target="_blank">Changes for Campus Group bookings Oct 2012 - PDF</a>
            <p>Voluntary organizations formed by members of the University community are a traditional part
              of campus life, and contribute in a significant way to its intellectual, political, social
              and cultural diversity and richness.
            </p>
            <p>In its relations with these organizations, the University is guided by a commitment to the
              right of University members to communicate and to discuss and explore all ideas, to organize
              groups for any lawful purpose, to move about the University and to use its facilities in
              any reasonable way, to distribute on campus, in a responsible way, published material provided
              that is not unlawful, to hold meetings, to debate and to engage in peaceful demonstrations,
              and to freedom from discrimination on the basis of sex, race or religion.
            </p>
            <p>Recognition as a "campus group" is a privilege based upon observance of certain procedures
              and acceptance of certain responsibilities. It follows that this privilege can be withdrawn
              if these procedures are neglected or responsibilities abrogated by the organization or
              group.
            </p>
            <p>Under the terms of this policy the University will not attempt to censor, control or interfere
              with any group on the basis of its philosophy, beliefs, interests or opinions expressed
              unless and until these lead to activities which are illegal or which infringe the rights
              and freedoms already mentioned. By the same token, recognition as a "campus group" by the
              University implies neither endorsement of a particular group's beliefs or philosophy, nor
              the assumption of legal liability for the group's activities. It assumes only that the
              University has a responsibility to inform itself of organizations which use its facilities
              and name and to deny or withdraw recognition if the requirements of this policy are not
              observed.
            </p>
            <p>1.(a) The University should maintain a policy and mechanism for the recognition of campus
              organizations. All such organizations wishing to use "University of Toronto" in their names
              and all groups wishing to claim internal status under the <a href="room_res.html#gp" onclick="window.location.reload();">Policy for the Allocation of
              Rooms</a> - Extracurricular Bookings must be recognized. (b) Responsibility for the maintenance
              of the policy and mechanism, where campus-wide organizations or organizations drawing members
              from more than one division or constituency of the University are concerned, should be
              vested in the Committee on Campus and Community Affairs of the Governing Council. (c) The
              responsibility for recognition of organizations drawing members from only one division
              should rest with the council of that division.
            </p>
            <p>2. Eligibility for recognition should be assessed annually against the following "technical"
              constitutional areas rather than ideological ones:
            </p>
            <p>(a) The objectives and activities of groups seeking recognition should be seen as attempting
              to contribute to the educational, recreational, social or cultural value of the University.
              These values are intended to be interpreted in the broadest sense. However, the essential
              "value" of the University must remain that of preservation of freedom of enquiry and association.
            </p>
            <p>(b) Recognized campus groups may not engage in activities which are essentially commercial
              in nature. This is not intended to preclude the collection of membership fees to cover
              the expenses of the organization, or of charges for specific activities, programs or events,
              or to prohibit groups from engaging in legitimate fundraising. However, a recognized campus
              group cannot
            </p>
            <p>(i) have as a major activity a function that makes it an on-campus part of a commercial organization;
            </p>
            <p>(ii) provide services and goods at a profit when that profit is used for purposes other than
              those of the organization;
            </p>
            <p>(iii) pay salaries to some or all of its officers.
            </p>
            <p>(c) Membership in groups should be open to all members of the University community without
              restriction on the grounds of national origin, race, religion, colour, or sex. While discriminatory
              membership practices are not allowed, it is recognized that certain groups could well be
              homogenous in nature without being discriminatory. Status as non-voting members may be
              extended to interested persons from outside the University.
            </p>
            <p>(d) The University's interest in the constitution is based on its concern that organizations
              and individuals using its name and its facilities are genuine campus organizations, and
              that they pursue activities in accordance with the law, and in addition that such things
              as organizational structure, membership, procedures, rules of conduct, etc. are spelled
              out so that all members who join a club and take part in its activities may do so with
              full knowledge of their rights and responsibilities within the group.
            </p>
            <p>3. (a) The University will not attempt to monitor or review the activities of a group in
              the normal course of events. It will however investigate complaints or charges that an
              organization has acted in a manner that is inconsistent with its constitution or with the
              requirements of this policy. If these complaints or charges prove to be valid, recognition
              may be withdrawn. Application for a renewal of recognition may be made at any time after
              the following September 30.
            </p>
            <p>(b) Responsibility for the implementation of this policy is delegated to the administration.
              In the case of denial or withdrawal of recognition, a statement of the reasons will be
              provided. All administrative decisions to grant, deny or withdraw recognition will be reported
              regularly to the Committee on Campus and Community Affairs for information.
            </p>
            <p>(c) Groups wishing to appeal a decision may do so through the Office of the Assistant Vice-President
              - Student Affairs. In the event of an appeal, a hearing shall be held by an administrative
              officer designated by the Assistant Vice-President - Student Affairs not involved in the
              original decision.
            </p>
            <p>4. Groups seeking recognition should supply the following:
            </p>
            <p>(a) An application in the form prescribed.
            </p>
            <p>(b) The names of two officers and a "contact person" (who could be one of the officers) responsible
              for all room bookings and rentals of University equipment and services, a mailing address
              and a telephone number. This information will be considered to be public information.
            </p>
            <p>(c) The total number of members, the size of the governing body (i.e., number of executive
              officers), and the proportion of members on and off campus at the time of registration.
            </p>
            <p>(d) A copy of the constitution and/or by-laws of the group.
            </p>
            <p>Groups meeting the requirements of this policy will be granted recognition for the academic
              year in which application is made. (For this purpose the academic year is considered to
              run from October 1 to September 30.)
            </p>
            <p>Normally recognition will be renewed automatically in successive academic years upon request
              by the new executive. If constitutional changes have been proposed the amended constitution
              should be submitted and will be considered in the course of the renewal process.
            </p>
            <p>5. Applicants for recognition or recognized groups handling extensive funds may be required
              to submit audited statements annually to the Office of the Assistant Vice-President - Student
              Affairs.
            </p>
            <p>At the discretion of the Assistant Vice-President - Student Affairs groups supplying goods
              or services for which a charge is made may be required to indicate in all advertising,
              contractual and other material that the University neither endorses the group's activities
              nor assumes legal liability in connection with the goods and services provided.
