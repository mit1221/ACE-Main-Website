        <p>For immediate assistance in the classroom:<br>Use the <strong>live intercom</strong> on a Teaching
          Station or TSJr or call the A/V emergency hotline:<br><strong>416 - 978 - 0423</strong></p>

        <p>ACE provides and supports A/V equipment for 'centrally booked' classrooms (the rooms you can
          book on this site). If your classroom is not an 'ACE' room, A/V is likely handled by your local
          department. ACE and non-ACE can be located in the same building (even next to one another).
        </p>
        <p>For ACE rooms:</p>
        <p><strong>Academic Bookings: </strong>A/V* is included in room cost<br><strong>Non-academic bookings: </strong>A/V*
          is extra cost</p>
        <p>* This includes the Teaching Station, TSJr, and any ceiling-mounted digital projector. Always
          specify all your A/V needs at time of booking. Academic bookings likely require a course code.

          <h3>What & Where</h3>
          <p>Access to audio-visual equipment/instructional technology varies across the campus. Some buildings
            house electronic classrooms which offer a wide range of equipment (from data projectors,
            screens, sound systems, internet access) whereas other classrooms offer only basic facilities
            (screens and overhead projectors). See our <a href="../class_spec">Classroom Descriptions</a>            for info on ACE rooms and their equipment.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Who</h3>
          <p>In addition, your access to audio visual equipment and classroom technology support is linked
            to the department/division/college with which you are associated. Although Academic + Campus
            Events provides support for the majority of the St. George campus classrooms, some Colleges
            and Divisions have internal support offices. The information provided on this site primarily
            pertains to centrally booked classroom ACE on the St. George Campus. There are over 250 centrally-booked
            classrooms that are maintained and served by the Academic + Campus Events. Check our
            <a href="class_tec_contact.html">contact list</a> for buildings not directly serviced through
            Academic + Campus Events.

          <h3>Who should my first point of contact be if I'm thinking of using technology (A/V Equipment) in my classroom?</h3>
          <p>You should always speak to someone in your department/division first, such as your undergraduate
            chair/associate chair. He/she will be able to tell you what sort of equipment and support
            your department/division may have in place. They may refer you to the Office of Space Management
            to discuss possibilities.

          <h3>How can I book audio-visual equipment?</h3>
          <p>Consult your department/division/college to determine how bookings are made. Many departments
            have one contact person who is charged with making all the necessary arrangements.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>When should I book equipment?</h3>
          <p>In general, it is advisable to make arrangements as early as possible (e.g. a few weeks before
            you actually need the equipment). Keep in mind, at the start of each term the Classroom Technology
            Support Office receives hundreds of requests - it is always a good idea to submit your requests
            early! Try to avoid last minute requests. Also, when requesting equipment, be sure to arrange
            for an operator if you need help setting up the equipment.

          <p>Bookings made through Academic + Campus Events have charges associated with them (for equipment
            and technicians, if requested). In order to request A/V equipment through the ACE, departmental
            account numbers are needed. Please be sure that these costs are approved before making a
            request.

          <h3>Can I bring in my own equipment?</h3>
          <p>Yes. In fact, in some cases this may be required, particularly if you wish to make power point
            presentations or access the internet, in which case you may need to bring in your own computer/laptop.
            However, you may wish to consult with the Office of Space Management or your department/division
            as some equipment may not be suited for the classroom in which you are teaching.

          <h3>How do I ensure that my course is scheduled in a room that can accommodate my audiovisual / technology needs?</h3>
          <p>By communicating your A/V needs early in the room allocation process these factors can be taken
            into account when determining a suitable location. Room allocations are typically handled
            within departments/divisions and therefore any special requests should be directed to the
            appropriate person.

          <h3>Check with your dept.</h3>
          <p>If you plan to incorporate audio-visual equipment in your course, be sure to check with your
            department/division before finalizing your syllabus and class plan. You'll want to make to
            sure that any associated costs will be covered and that that classroom you have been assigned
            can accommodate your needs.

        <section>
          <h3>Talk to the professionals</h3>
          <p>Consider talking to someone about the most effective ways to use technology in the classroom.
            There is at times an expectation among students that instructors will incorporate technology
            into the classroom setting - but not all subjects/classroom environments are suited for such
            use. For assistance with regards to effective use of instructional technology, contact:
          </p>

        <section>
          <h3>Plan ahead</h3>
          <p>Be sure to plan ahead if you wish to use technology in the classroom. Arrangements need to
            be made in advance, such as ordering the equipment through the appropriate office (often
            with a minimum of 1 week's notice), and last-minute requests run the risk of not being met.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Inform your dept.</h3>
          <p>During the room allocation process, be sure to inform your department/division if you have
            specific a/v needs. It is often difficult to make changes to room assignments after they
            have been finalized.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Visit the room ahead</h3>
          <p>When you receive the room assignment for your course, consider visiting the room before the
            first meeting of your class. This will allow you to familiarize yourself with the room, the
            placement of the a/v equipment and observe any limitations/restrictions that may exist.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Test the equipment</h3>
          <p>If possible, arrange for a time to test the audio-visual equipment in the classroom before
            you start teaching (e.g. before term begins, or on a day that your class is not scheduled).
            This will help to familiarize yourself with the room and the equipment and allow you to make
            any necessary adjustments before the class.
