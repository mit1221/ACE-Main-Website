          <h2>What & Where</h2>
          <p>Access to audio-visual equipment/instructional technology varies across the campus. Some buildings
            house electronic classrooms which offer a wide range of equipment (from data projectors,
            screens, sound systems, internet access) whereas other classrooms offer only basic facilities
            (screens and overhead projectors). See our <a href="../class_spec">Classroom Descriptions</a>            for info on ACE rooms and their equipment.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Who</h2>
          <p>In addition, your access to audio visual equipment and classroom technology support is linked
            to the department/division/college with which you are associated. Although Academic + Campus
            Events provides support for the majority of the St. George campus classrooms, some Colleges
            and Divisions have internal support offices. The information provided on this site primarily
            pertains to centrally booked classroom ACE on the St. George Campus. There are over 250 centrally-booked
            classrooms that are maintained and served by the Academic + Campus Events. Check our
            <a href="class_tec_contact.html">contact list</a> for buildings not directly serviced through
            Academic + Campus Events.

        <section>
          <h2>Who should my first point of contact be if I'm thinking of using technology (A/V Equipment) in my classroom?</h2>
          <p>You should always speak to someone in your department/division first, such as your undergraduate
            chair/associate chair. He/she will be able to tell you what sort of equipment and support
            your department/division may have in place. They may refer you to the Office of Space Management
            to discuss possibilities.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h2>How can I book audio-visual equipment?</h2>
          <p>Consult your department/division/college to determine how bookings are made. Many departments
            have one contact person who is charged with making all the necessary arrangements.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>When should I book equipment?</h2>
          <p>In general, it is advisable to make arrangements as early as possible (e.g. a few weeks before
            you actually need the equipment). Keep in mind, at the start of each term the Classroom Technology
            Support Office receives hundreds of requests - it is always a good idea to submit your requests
            early! Try to avoid last minute requests. Also, when requesting equipment, be sure to arrange
            for an operator if you need help setting up the equipment.

          <h2>Are there costs involved? who pays?</h2>
          <p>Bookings made through Academic + Campus Events have charges associated with them (for equipment
            and technicians, if requested). In order to request a/v equipment through the ACE, departmental
            account numbers are needed. Please be sure that these costs are approved before making a
            request.
