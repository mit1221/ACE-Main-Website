          <h3>What & Where</h3>
          <p>Access to audio-visual equipment/instructional technology varies across the campus. Some buildings house electronic classrooms which offer a wide range of equipment (from data projectors, screens, sound systems, internet access) whereas other
            classrooms offer only basic facilities (screens and overhead projectors). See our <a href="../class_spec">Classroom Descriptions</a> for info on ACE rooms and their equipment.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Who</h3>
          <p>In addition, your access to audio visual equipment and classroom technology support is linked to the department/division/college with which you are associated. Although Academic + Campus Events provides support for the majority of the St. George
            campus classrooms, some Colleges and Divisions have internal support offices. The information provided on this site primarily pertains to centrally booked classroom ACE on the St. George Campus. There are over 250 centrally-booked classrooms
            that are maintained and served by the Academic + Campus Events. Check our
            <a href="class_tec_contact.html">contact list</a> for buildings not directly serviced through Academic + Campus Events.

          <h3>Who should my first point of contact be if I'm thinking of using technology (A/V Equipment) in my classroom?</h3>
          <p>You should always speak to someone in your department/division first, such as your undergraduate chair/associate chair. He/she will be able to tell you what sort of equipment and support your department/division may have in place. They may refer
            you to the Office of Space Management to discuss possibilities.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>How can I book audio-visual equipment?</h3>
          <p>Consult your department/division/college to determine how bookings are made. Many departments have one contact person who is charged with making all the necessary arrangements.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>When should I book equipment?</h3>
          <p>In general, it is advisable to make arrangements as early as possible (e.g. a few weeks before you actually need the equipment). Keep in mind, at the start of each term the Classroom Technology Support Office receives hundreds of requests -
            it is always a good idea to submit your requests early! Try to avoid last minute requests. Also, when requesting equipment, be sure to arrange for an operator if you need help setting up the equipment.

          <h3>Are there costs involved? who pays?</h3>
          <p>Bookings made through Academic + Campus Events have charges associated with them (for equipment and technicians, if requested). In order to request A/V equipment through the ACE, departmental account numbers are needed. Please be sure that these
            costs are approved before making a request.

          <h3>What sort of equipment is available?</h3>
          <p>The types of equipment currently available includes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Standard Teaching Station & TSJr control stations</li>
            <li>Overhead projectors (for transparencies) (available in most classrooms at all times)</li>
            <li>Data Projectors (digital projection)</li>
            <li>TV monitors</li>
            <li>VCRs/DVD Players</li>
            <li>Slide Projectors</li>
            <li>Stereos (cassette and/or cd players)</li>
            <li>Sound systems</li>
          </ul>
          <p>If you require a specific type of equipment not listed here or a particular set up in your classroom, the Office of Space Management will work with you to best meet your needs.
          </p>

          <h3>Can I bring in my own equipment?</h3>
          <p>Yes. In fact, in some cases this may be required, particularly if you wish to make power point presentations or access the internet, in which case you may need to bring in your own computer/laptop. However, you may wish to consult with the Office
            of Space Management or your department/division as some equipment may not be suited for the classroom in which you are teaching.
          </p>

          <h3>How do I ensure that my course is scheduled in a room that can accommodate my audiovisual / technology needs?</h3>
          <p>By communicating your A/V needs early in the room allocation process these factors can be taken into account when determining a suitable location. Room allocations are typically handled within departments/divisions and therefore any special
            requests should be directed to the appropriate person.

          <h3>Is internet access available in classrooms?</h3>
          <h4>For Instructors</h4>
          <p>Instructor wired internet is available via UTORid at all rooms with a Teaching Station or Teaching Station Jr. Some buildings have internet wall jacks that belong to a specific building network - like Sidney Smith and Bahen. IP (internet protocol)
            addresses for these rooms can be obtained from the Office of Space Management when you book equipment. Contact ACE to ask about a specific room.
          </p>
          <h4>Public/Wireless</h4>
          <p>The campus wireless internet network has been expanding rapidly, and provides access for all via UTORid. See the <a href="class_wireless.html">wireless</a> tab at the side menu.
