        <p>ACE provides and supports A/V equipment for 'centrally booked' classrooms (the rooms you can book on this site). If your classroom is not an 'ACE' room, A/V is likely handled by your local department. ACE and non-ACE can be located in the same
          building (even next to one another).
        </p>
        <p>For ACE rooms:</p>
        <p><strong>Academic Bookings: </strong>A/V* is included in room cost<br><strong>Non-academic bookings: </strong>A/V* is extra cost</p>
        <p>* This includes the Teaching Station, TSJr, and any ceiling-mounted digital projector. Always specify all your A/V needs at time of booking. Academic bookings likely require a course code.</p>

          <h3>What & Where</h3>
          <p>Access to audio-visual equipment/instructional technology varies across the campus. Some buildings house electronic classrooms which offer a wide range of equipment (from data projectors, screens, sound systems, internet access) whereas other
            classrooms offer only basic facilities (screens and overhead projectors). See our <a href="../class_spec">Classroom Descriptions</a> for info on ACE rooms and their equipment.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Who</h3>
          <p>In addition, your access to audio visual equipment and classroom technology support is linked to the department/division/college with which you are associated. Although Academic + Campus Events provides support for the majority of the St. George
            campus classrooms, some Colleges and Divisions have internal support offices. The information provided on this site primarily pertains to centrally booked classroom ACE on the St. George Campus. There are over 250 centrally-booked classrooms
            that are maintained and served by the Academic + Campus Events. Check our
            <a href="class_tec_contact.html">contact list</a> for buildings not directly serviced through Academic + Campus Events.

        <h3>Booking</h3>
        <section>
          <h3>Who should my first point of contact be if I'm thinking of using technology (A/V Equipment) in my classroom?</h3>
          <p>You should always speak to someone in your department/division first, such as your undergraduate chair/associate chair. He/she will be able to tell you what sort of equipment and support your department/division may have in place. They may refer
            you to the Office of Space Management to discuss possibilities.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>How can I book audio-visual equipment?</h3>
          <p>Consult your department/division/college to determine how bookings are made. Many departments have one contact person who is charged with making all the necessary arrangements.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>When should I book equipment?</h3>
          <p>In general, it is advisable to make arrangements as early as possible (e.g. a few weeks before you actually need the equipment). Keep in mind, at the start of each term the Classroom Technology Support Office receives hundreds of requests -
            it is always a good idea to submit your requests early! Try to avoid last minute requests. Also, when requesting equipment, be sure to arrange for an operator if you need help setting up the equipment.

        <h3>Costs</h3>
        <section>
          <h3>Are there costs involved? who pays?</h3>
          <p>Bookings made through Academic + Campus Events have charges associated with them (for equipment and technicians, if requested). In order to request A/V equipment through the ACE, departmental account numbers are needed. Please be sure that these
            costs are approved before making a request.
          </p>
          <p>For ACE rooms:<br>A/V charges for Departments/External/Campus Groups are below.

          <p>Typical charges are $100 to access the AV equipment + $20 setup (Assist) = <span class="cost">$135.60</span>

          <h3>Can I bring in my own equipment?</h3>
          <p>Yes. In fact, in some cases this may be required, particularly if you wish to make power point presentations or access the internet, in which case you may need to bring in your own computer/laptop. However, you may wish to consult with the Office

          <h3>Talk to the professionals</h3>
          <p>Consider talking to someone about the most effective ways to use technology in the classroom. There is at times an expectation among students that instructors will incorporate technology into the classroom setting - but not all subjects/classroom
            environments are suited for such use. For assistance with regards to effective use of instructional technology, contact:

          <h3>Plan ahead</h3>
          <p>Be sure to plan ahead if you wish to use technology in the classroom. Arrangements need to be made in advance, such as ordering the equipment through the appropriate office (often with a minimum of 1 week's notice), and last-minute requests
            run the risk of not being met.

          <h3>Inform your dept.</h3>
          <p>During the room allocation process, be sure to inform your department/division if you have specific a/v needs. It is often difficult to make changes to room assignments after they have been finalized.

          <h3>Visit the room ahead</h3>
          <p>When you receive the room assignment for your course, consider visiting the room before the first meeting of your class. This will allow you to familiarize yourself with the room, the placement of the a/v equipment and observe any limitations/restrictions
            that may exist.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h3>Test the equipment</h3>
          <p>If possible, arrange for a time to test the audio-visual equipment in the classroom before you start teaching (e.g. before term begins, or on a day that your class is not scheduled). This will help to familiarize yourself with the room and the
            equipment and allow you to make any necessary adjustments before the class.
