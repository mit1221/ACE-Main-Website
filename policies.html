          <div class="majorSection">
            <section>
              <p>Voluntary organizations formed by members of the University community are a traditional
                part of campus life, and contribute in a significant way to its intellectual, political,
                social and cultural diversity and richness.
              </p>
              <p>In its relations with these organizations, the University is guided by a commitment to
                the right of University members to communicate and to discuss and explore all ideas,
                to organize groups for any lawful purpose, to move about the University and to use its
                facilities in any reasonable way, to distribute on campus, in a responsible way, published
                material provided that is not unlawful, to hold meetings, to debate and to engage in
                peaceful demonstrations, and to freedom from discrimination on the basis of sex, race
                or religion.
              </p>
              <p>Recognition as a "campus group" is a privilege based upon observance of certain procedures
                and acceptance of certain responsibilities. It follows that this privilege can be withdrawn
                if these procedures are neglected or responsibilities abrogated by the organization or
                group.
              </p>
              <p>Under the terms of this policy the University will not attempt to censor, control or interfere
                with any group on the basis of its philosophy, beliefs, interests or opinions expressed
                unless and until these lead to activities which are illegal or which infringe the rights
                and freedoms already mentioned. By the same token, recognition as a "campus group" by
                the University implies neither endorsement of a particular group's beliefs or philosophy,
                nor the assumption of legal liability for the group's activities. It assumes only that
                the University has a responsibility to inform itself of organizations which use its facilities
                and name and to deny or withdraw recognition if the requirements of this policy are not
                observed.

                  <ol>
                    <li type="a">The objectives and activities of groups seeking recognition should be seen as attempting
                      to contribute to the educational, recreational, social or cultural value of the
                      University. These values are intended to be interpreted in the broadest sense.
                      However, the essential "value" of the University must remain that of preservation
                      of freedom of enquiry and association.
                    </li>
                    <li type="a">Recognized campus groups may not engage in activities which are essentially commercial
                      in nature. This is not intended to preclude the collection of membership fees to
                      cover the expenses of the organization, or of charges for specific activities,
                      programs or events, or to prohibit groups from engaging in legitimate fundraising.
                      However, a recognized campus group cannot:
                      <ol>
                        <li type="i">have as a major activity a function that makes it an on-campus part of a commercial

                        </li>
                        <li type="i">provide services and goods at a profit when that profit is used for purposes
                          other than those of the organization;
                        </li>
                        <li type="i">pay salaries to some or all of its officers.</li>

                      restriction on the grounds of national origin, race, religion, colour, or sex.
                      While discriminatory membership practices are not allowed, it is recognized that
                      certain groups could well be homogenous in nature without being discriminatory.
                      Status as non-voting members may be extended to interested persons from outside
                      the University.
                    </li>

                    <li type="a">The University's interest in the constitution is based on its concern that organizations
                      and individuals using its name and its facilities are genuine campus organizations,
                      and that they pursue activities in accordance with the law, and in addition that
                      such things as organizational structure, membership, procedures, rules of conduct,
                      etc. are spelled out so that all members who join a club and take part in its activities
                      may do so with full knowledge of their rights and responsibilities within the group.

                      that an organization has acted in a manner that is inconsistent with its constitution
                      or with the requirements of this policy. If these complaints or charges prove to
                      be valid, recognition may be withdrawn. Application for a renewal of recognition
                      may be made at any time after the following September 30.</li>

                  <li>No weapons, ammunition or fireworks (authentic or replica) are permitted on University
                    property.
                  </li>
                  <li>For productions that do not involve University events and activities, every effort
                    should be made to maintain the anonymity of the University, including promotion and
                    credits; the University, however, may require that it be identified if it feels this
                    would be in its interest.
                  </li>
                  <li>Whenever a Location Fee is being charged, an agreement will be entered into between
                    the University and the Production agency (see attached Form of Agreement).
                  </li>
                  <li>Requests for filming must normally be made at least two weeks in advance and in no
                    case will be accepted fewer than ten days in advance.
                  </li>
                  <li>Notwithstanding the terms and conditions of this policy, the Film Liaison Service has
                    the right to refuse any request for filming on the premises of the University. Factors
                    in such a decision may include the reputation and financial security of the production
                    agency, and the history of previous dealings with that agency.

                <p class="important">Fees and policy listed here are subject to confirmation with ACE / University Film Liaison</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>A Location Fee of <span class="cost">$4,000</span> per day will be charged to any production
                    agency using University locations for the purposes of producing feature films, television
                    commercials, and general entertainment programs.
                  </li>
                  <li>The <strong>Location Fee</strong> may be waived for non-commercial production agencies
                    and public broadcasting institutions producing educational and public interest programs,
                    including documentaries.
                  </li>
                  <li>A minimum <strong>Survey and Clearance Fee</strong> of <span class="cost">$100</span>                    will be charged to all users of the Film Liaison Service as soon as it is apparent
                    to the Film Liaison Service that a University location may be suitable for their
                    needs. Assessing such a fee, payable in advance, does not imply that final permission
                    will be granted. This fee may be waived for student groups producing films as part
                    of their academic program at other educational institutions.
                  </li>
                  <li>When a Location Fee is assessed, the Survey and Clearance Fee will be deducted.</li>
                  <li>For <strong>interior locations</strong>, up to one-third of the Location Fee received
                    will, where appropriate, be distributed amongst those divisions occupying the space
                    being used.
                  </li>
                  <li>Where <strong>rental charges</strong> normally exist for certain University rooms (e.g.
                    Convocation Hall, Innis Town Hall), that charge will be paid out of the Location
                    Fee up to a maximum of 50% of the Location Fee. University divisions that normally
                    rent space may waive their normal rental charges in lieu of receiving one-third of
                    the Location Fee.
                  </li>
                  <li>The cost of any additional services provided by the University, including <strong>security, parking,
                  trades and caretaking</strong>, will be charged in addition to the Location Fee. Because
                    of existing union contracts, security and other applicable trades must be provided
                    by the University. Decisions as to which of these services are required for any film
                    location will be decided by the University in accordance with general policy and
                    procedures. For every location, at least one security officer must be engaged.
                  </li>
                  <li>The <strong>Survey and Clearance Fee</strong> will be payable to the University prior
                    to the undertaking of location surveys and coordinating arrangements. Location Fees
                    will be payable prior to the commencement of filming. Other fees will be payable
                    when billed.
                  </li>
                  <li>Production agencies filming at the University must agree to hold the University harmless
                    of any <strong>liability and loss</strong> which the University may suffer or incur
                    by reason of any injury to any person or damage to any property caused by the Producer
                    or any of its employees or equipment, or any other persons introduced to the premises
                    by reason of such filming. Evidence must be provided of liability insurance coverage
                    in the amount of at least $2,000,000 and showing The Governing Council of the University
                    of Toronto as co-insured, and a bond may be required according to the procedures
                    of the Academic and Campus Events whenever major damage might be done to University
                    property.
                  </li>
                  <li>All arrangements, including the payment of Location Fees, evidence of insurance, and
                    the execution of agreements or posting of bonds when required, must be completed
                    at least <strong>48
                  hours</strong> prior to the commencement of filming.
                  </li>
                  <li>A <strong>Cancellation Fee</strong> of 50% of the payable Location Fee will be charged.
                    Rescheduling of dates will be considered as a new request. The Survey and Clearance
                    Fee is not refundable.
                  </li>
                  <li>Production agencies filming at the University which need auxiliary sources of
                    <strong>power</strong> must use silenced generators and suspend or cover all cables
                    at their own expense.
